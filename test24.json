      "review_text1": "This smoke and vanilla scented candle is an absolute delight. The combination of smoky and sweet aromas creates a perfect balance that is both relaxing and invigorating. The smoky scent is not overpowering and adds a touch of mystery to the ambiance, while the vanilla scent adds a comforting warmth. The fragrance lingers in the air long after the candle has been extinguished, filling the room with a cozy and inviting atmosphere. The candle burns evenly and cleanly, providing hours of enjoyment. Overall, this candle is perfect for those who love the cozy comfort of vanilla with a hint of smokiness for added depth"

      "review_text2": "Bought this on a whim for my room. I'm currently overseas and needed to experience a new scent. Candle arrived quickly and was packaged well. It lasted just over a week letting it burn for approximately 1.5hrs a day. My only small gripe is the wick burned out quickly, so as the days progressed it become increasingly more difficult to light the candle.\n\nOverall, I'm impressed and already ordered a different scent to try. I imagine I'll order them periodically throughout the remaining duration of my \"adventure.\""

      "review_text3": "This candle has become a go in our house, even amongst the many we have. A rustic, smudgy, smoky scent with good hot throw (the degree to which the candle's scent travels after it's lit). It's not the most sophisticated scent you'll ever smell, so it's not like top tier luxury candles which tend to have more complex formulations, but it's a wonderfully strong, charred scent that can easily blot out any unpleasant smells going on. I do think it's a bit silly that some candles are designated \"for men,\" so I'm taking one star off for that. As a woman, I've always gravitated toward robust, woodsy fragrances just like this one, so I find the marketing a little retrograde here."

      "review_text5": "I'm not sure what size room others may be using this candle in, but in my average sized bedroom this candle easily fills the room with its scent. I never find myself \"blind\" to the smell. It's very noticeable when walking into a room that the candle has been burning in. I will be happy to try some of the other scents this company has."

      "review_text6": "These candles are great~ not waxy like most store bought candles. Strong, lasting scent. The jar and label make it look exquisite. The wick is really nice and different. That's the 1st thing I noticed about this candle. It does not look cheaply made. I enjoyed my first one so much, I ordered 2 more (before I realized they send a 'Buy One Get One Free' coupon in every box!) I chose \"Vintage Leather\" scent."

The MOST impressive part was the perfect burn! I just finished it off and there\u2019s no wax left in the jar. As someone who hates battling expensive candles to the bitter end I\u2019m stunned and excited to order another scent after I post this review \ud83e\udd29"

I used it in my dining hall where usually a room spray won't work, but this worked perfectly well. I'm definitely going to buy more."

It was a good combo since the flame adds to the burning smell and the marshmallow scent smells great. It reminds me when I was camping in high school. The other flavors are good too but I wish there was an option to have two marshmallow.\n\nOne tip with burning candle is to ensure all the surface wax is melted in liquid form before blowing it out. You can also cheat by using a heat gun to melt the side. This way they will burn evenly on subsequent burns. Hope this helps. I learned it the hard way."

When I went to buy it again (at regular price) this one, in a white jar, was on sale and thinking they\u2019d be the same (same company, same scent, both soy) I bought two of these instead. I was so wrong. I hated the wood wick, it\u2019s VERY difficult to trim (I found good toenail clippers worked best) and burns so high & hard that it felt dangerous. Also while the scents are possibly the same, the white jar doesn\u2019t seem as strong, doesn\u2019t fill the room with the same wonderful smell and the scent doesn\u2019t last as long even with the raging fire from the wick. It has sage, but smells more perfume like, dominant scent comes more from spices & maybe resins, but it\u2019s still pleasing although I didn\u2019t use for smudging as I had planned.\n\nAs the price for both candles is regularly the same, don\u2019t get the white jar (unless it\u2019s 1/2 price & you can stand over the candle while it burns), buy the Craft & Kin white sage in the amber jar with a regular wick.
